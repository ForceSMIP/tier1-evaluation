# tier1-evaluation
Code for evaluating statistical and machine learning methods using the ForceSMIP Tier1 dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15577519). 

This repository contains:
- MATLAB scripts used for all analysis in Wills et al., submitted to Journal of Climate (June 10, 2025)
- (in progress) A Python notebook for evaluating a new or exisiting method's estimated forced trends within the ForceSMIP dataset (e.g., compared to the 30 ForceSMIP methods presented in Wills et al.) will be added summer 2025
